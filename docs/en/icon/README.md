# Icon

There are some built-in social icons in the theme, all from [iconcont](https://www.iconcont.cn/):

![icons](../../.vuepress/public/iconfont.png)

Just fill the beginning of 'icon-' into CSS class, eg: `iconfont icon-twitter-fill`.

The icons are mainly used in related pages, of course, you can also use any place by HTML. 

If you want to use other icons, you can use [Custom CSS](/en/guide/#custom-js-css-html) to include your own Iconcont or Font-Awesome, and then insert them to css class.
